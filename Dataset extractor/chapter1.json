        "question": "Question 2. Why is the amount of gas collected in one of the test tubes in Activity",
        "answer": "Water (H 2 O) contains two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen. The ratio of water components i.e., hydrogen and oxygen is 2:1. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen and oxygen produced after water electrolysis is in a ratio of 2:1. This is why during electrolysis the amount of gas collected in hydrogen’s test tubes is double the amount collected in the oxygen’s test tube.   Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes at its base and fit rubber stoppers in these holes. Insert carbon electrodes in these rubber stoppers as shown in Figure. Connect these electrodes to a 6-volt battery. Fill the mug with water such that the electrodes are immersed. Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to the water. Take two test tubes filled with water and invert them over the two carbon electrodes. Switch on the current and leave the apparatus undisturbed for some time. You will observe the formation of bubbles at both electrodes. These bubbles displace water in the test tubes. Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes? Once the test tubes are filled with the respective gases. Remove them carefully. Test these gases one by one by bringing a burning candle close to the mouth of the test tubes. Caution: This step must be performed carefully by the teacher. What happens in each case? Which gas is present in each test tube? Text Book Part I Page No. 13"

        "question": "Question 1. Why does the colour of copper sulphate solution change when an iron nail is dipped in it?",
        "answer": "Iron is more reactive than copper. When an iron nail is dipped in copper sulphate solution, iron forms its sulphate (iron sulphate) solution by displacing copper of copper sulphate. The colour of iron sulphate is green. So, colour change in solution appears."

H 2 (g) + Cl 2 (g) → 2HCl(g); Combination reaction. In the first equation, since ZnCO 3  is broken down into ZnO and CO 2  it is a decomposition reaction. In the second equation, H 2  and Cl 2  combine to give a new substance HCl. Therefore, it is a combination reaction."

For example, rusting of iron products. (b) Rancidity: The Process in which fats and oils or food products made from fats or oils get oxidised resulting in a change of smell and the taste is called rancidity. For example, food items made from oil like chips becomes rancid if kept open for some time. To prevent rancidity antioxidants (which prevent oxidation) are added to food containing fats and oils. Rancidity can also be prevented by flushing out oxygen with a gas like nitrogen. For example packets of food items like chips are flushed with nitrogen so that those can be used even after long duration. KSEEB SSLC Class 10 Science Chapter 1 Additional Questions and Answers"
