            "answer": "Air, also contains other gases like nitrogen, carbon dioxide and few more gases apart from oxygen. When ethyne is burnt in air, it gives a sooty flame. This is due to incomplete combustion caused by the limited supply of oxygen. However, if ethyne is burnt with oxygen, it gives a clean flame with temperature 3000°C because of complete combustion. This oxy-acetylene flame is used for welding. It is not possible to attain such a high temperature without mixing oxygen. This is the reason why a mixture of ethyne and air is not used, 2HC ≡ CH + 5O 2  → 4CO 2  + 2H 2 O + Heat."

We can observe the gas bubbles in test tube B. No such bubbles are seen in test tube A. Pass the gas produced in test tube B through lime water taken in another test tube We will find that lime water turns milky It is a test for carbon dioxide. Hence, this experiment proves that when ethanoic acid reacts with sodium hydrogen carbonate, then carbon dioxide gas is produced with an effervescence (a rapid evolution of gas bubbles).

Ethanoic acid has a melting point of 17°C. Since it is below the room temperature so, it freezes during winter. Moreover, ethanoic acid has a smell like vinegar. Ethanol does not react with metal carbonates while, ethanoic acid reacts with metal carbonates to form a salt, water and carbon dioxide. For example: 2CH 3 COOH + Na 2 CO 3  → 2CH 3 COONa + CO 2  +H 2 O Ethanol does not react with NaOH while ethanoic acid reacts with NaOH to form sodium ethanoate and water. For example, CH 3 COOH + NaOH → CH 3 COONa + H 2 O Ethanol is oxidized to give ethanoic acid in the presence of acidified KMnO 4  while no reaction takes place with ethanoic acid in the presence of acidified KMnO 4 . Difference in physical properties: Ethanol Ethanoic acid This is in liquid form at room temperature. Its melting point is 156° K. Its melting point is 290K and hence it often freezes during winter in cold climates. Difference in chemical properties Ethanol will not react with metallic carbo­nates.

            "answer": "A soap molecule has two ends. One end is hydrophilic and another end is hydrophobic. When soap is dissolved in water and clothes are put in the soapy solution, soap molecules converge in a typical manner to make a structure is called micelle. The hydrophobic ends of different molecules surround a particle of grease and make the micelle, which is a spherical structure. In this, the hydrophilic end is outside the sphere and hydrophobic end is towards the centre of the sphere. This is why micelle formation takes place when soap is added to water. Since ethanol is not as polar as soap, micelles will not be formed in other solvents such as ethanol."

The haemoglobin pigment present in the blood gets attached to four O 2  molecules that are obtained from breathing. It thus, forms oxyhaemoglobin and the blood turns oxygenated. This oxygenated blood is distributed to all the body cells by the heart. After giving away O 2  to the body cells, blood takes away CO 2  which is the end product of cellular respiration. Now, the blood becomes de-oxygenated. Since, haemoglobin pigment has less affinity for CO 2 , CO 2  is mainly transported in the dissolved form. This de-oxygenated blood gives CO 2  to lung’s alveoli and takes O 2  in return."

            "answer": "Separation of pure and impure blood is necessary to keep oxygenated and deoxygenated blood away from mixing. Warm-blooded animals such as birds and mammals maintain a constant body temperature by cooling themselves when they are in a hotter environment and by warming their bodies when, they are in a cooler environment. Hence, these animals require more oxygen (O 2 ) for more cellular respiration so that they can produce more energy to maintain their body temperature. Such separation helps in a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body."

Functions of nephrons: Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose, amino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are selectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much excess water there is in the body, and on how much of dissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming in each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter, which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out through the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is under nervous control. As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate."

            "answer": "A circulation system in which blood pumps through the heart twice during each trip around the body is called double circulatory system. Firstly, blood is pumped into the lungs, where it receives oxygen and becomes oxygenated, and is then pumped back into the heart, before it is finally pumped into the rest of the body. The human heart has four chambers – the right atrium, the right ventricle, the left atrium and the left ventricle. Pathway of blood in the heart: The heart has superior and inferior vena cava, which carries de- oxygenated blood from the upper and lower regions of the body respectively and supplies this de-oxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart. The right atrium then contracts and passes the de-oxygenated blood to the right ventricle, through an auriculo – ventricular aperture. Then, the right ventricle contracts and passes the de-oxygenated blood into the two pulmonary arteries, which pumps it to the lungs where the blood becomes oxygenated. From the lungs, the pulmonary veins transport the oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. Then, the left atrium contracts and through the auricular-ventricular aperture, the oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle. The blood passes to aorta from the left ventricle. The aorta gives rise to many arteries that distribute the oxygenated blood to all the regions of the body. Therefore, the blood goes twice through the heart. This is known as double circulation. Importance of double circulation: The separation of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood allows a more efficient supply of oxygen to every single cells. This efficient system of oxygen supply is very useful in warm-blooded animals such as human beings. As we know, warm-blooded animals have to maintain a constant body temperature. Thus, the circulatory system of humans becomes more efficient because of the double circulation."

            "answer": "In animals, control and coordination occur with the help of nervous system. However, plants do not have a nervous system. Plants respond to stimuli by showing movements. The growth, development and responses, to the environment in plants is controlled and coordinated by a special class of chemical substances known as hormones. These hormones are produced in one part of the plant body and are translocated to other needy parts. For example, a hormone produced in roots is translocated to other parts when required. The five major types of phytohormones are auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. These phytohormones are either growth promoters (such as auxins, gibberellins cytokinins and ethylene) or growth inhibitors such as abscisic acid."

            "answer": "Controlled movement must be connected to the recognition of various events in the enviroment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other words, living organisms must use systems providing control and coordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation. In multi cellular organisms, specilised tissues are used to provide these control and coordination activities. In animals such control and coordination are provided by nervous and muscular tissues."

            "answer": "Movement in sensitive plants The movement that takes place in a sensitive plant such as Mimosa pudica occurs in response to touch (stimulus). For this movement, the information is transmitted from cell to cell by electric chemical signals as plants do not have any specialised tissue for conduction of impulses. For this movement to occur, the plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water in them. Movement in our legs Movement in our legs is an example of voluntary actions. The signal or messages for these no action are passed to the brain and hence are consciously controlled. In animal muscle cells, some proteins are found which allow the movement to occur."

Genetic informations are carried by DNA from parental generation to daughter generations. In reproduction, it is very important to create a DNA copy. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information source for making proteins. Cells undergo different chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This creates two copies of the DNA in a single reproducing cell. It is therefore, possible for the organism to produce organism of similar type."

            "answer": "Variations are a kind of change in genotype of an individual. These changes are caused by sudden or slow change in surroundings and other associated factors with individuals or species. It is found that for a species, the environmental conditions change so drastically that their survival becomes difficult. Thus, their internal genotype changes to give offspring resistant to the surrounding and these variants help in the survival of the species. However, variations are not necessary for the individual organisms as preservation of specific species character. Variation has nothing to do with normal life processes."

In binary fission, a single cell divides into two equal halves but it is possible only with very simple single cell kind. Amoeba and Bacteria divide by binary fission. Multiple fission: Another type of simple division is multiple fission, in this, a single cell divides into many daughter, cells, e.g., Plasmodium divide by multiple fission. Binary fission Multiple fission In this fission, one cell split into two equal halves during cell division. Eg: Bacteria. Here one organism divide into many daughter cells simultaneously. Eg: yeast. Question 2. How will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores?",
            "answer": "One among the best and common types of vegetative reproduction is reproduction through spores. Advantages of spore formation:   Huge numbers of spores are produced at a time. Distribution of spores are very easy by air to far-off places to avoid competition at one place. Spores can store genetic informations for very long time as they are covered by thick walls to prevent dehydration and other unfavourable conditions for new ones development."

            "answer": "The ability to produce new individual organisms from their body parts or give rise to new individual from cut or broken up parts is called regeneration. For example, simple animals like Hydra and Planaria. Higher complex organisms cannot give rise to new individuals through regeneration because regeneration is carried out by very specialised cells which is particular to some very particular species. These cells proliferate and forms mass of cells, which undergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. Every complex organism have multiple level of organization, hence it is very difficult to regenerate complete body capable of growth and development. All the organ systems of their body work together as a unit. They can regenerate their lost body parts such as skin, muscles, blood etc. However, they cannot give rise to new individuals through regeneration."

            "answer": "Because plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods also make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange, rose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another advantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are genetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its characteristics."

            "answer": "Genetic informations are carried by DNA from parental generation to daughter generations. In reproduction, it is very important to create a DNA copy. It determines the body design of an individual. The reproducing cells produce a copy of their DNA through complicated chemical reactions and result in almost equal two copies of DNA. The copying of DNA always takes place along with the creation of additional cellular structure. This process is then followed by division of a cell to form two cells. While copying it preserves the genetic character or genotype of parents and hence, reproduce almost similar looking and working individuals."

The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a special tissue called placenta. It is embedded in the uterine wall. Placenta contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue and blood spaces on mother’s side surrounding the villi. This provides a large surface from mother to the embryo and waste products from embryo to mother."

Copper ions prevent pregnancy by inhibiting the movement of sperm, because the copper-lon-containing fluids are toxic to sperm. And, if a spermatozoa fertilizes an egg, the copper ion prevents implantation of the fertilized egg, and thus check pregnancy. But, it do not stop entrance of fluids inside the female body. Hence, it will not protect women from sexually transmitted diseases."

            "answer": "In female body, blood and mucous flows out every month through the vagina which is termed menstruation. If the egg present inside uterus does not get fertilised, then the lining of the uterus breaks down slowly and comes out in the form of blood and mucous from the vagina. This is complete process of menstruation. This process occurs every month as one egg is released from the ovary every month and at the same time, the uterus (womb) prepares itself to receive the fertilised egg. Thus, the inner lining of the uterus gets thickened and is supplied with blood to nourish the embryo."

Some of best methods are given below: • Natural methods: It involves avoiding the chances of meeting of sperms and ovum. In this method, the sexual intercourse is avoided by the couple from day 10th to 17th of the menstrual cycle of female as in this period, ovulation is expected and therefore, the chances of fertilisation are very high. • Barrier methods: In this method, the fertilisation of ovum and sperm is checked out with the help of artificially developed barriers. Barriers are developed for both males and females. Most common barriers available in market are condoms. • Oral contraceptives: In this method, tablets or drugs are taken orally by females to check pregnancy. These contain small doses of hormones in forms of pills that prevent the release of eggs and thus, fertilisation can not occur. . • Implants and surgical methods: Contraceptive devices are also developed as the loop or Copper-T to prevent pregnancy. Surgical methods are also used to block the gamete transfer. It includes the blocking of vas deferens to prevent the transfer of sperms known as vasectomy. Similarly, in tubectomy in this fallopian tubes of the ’female can be blocked, so that the egg will not reach the uterus."

What do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short plant with wrinkled seeds look like? They are all tall and have round seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits, But what happens when these F 1  progeny are used to generate F 2  progeny by self pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find that some F 2  progeny are tall plants with round seeds and some were short plants with wrinkled seeds. However there would also be some F 2  progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them would be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short, but have round seeds, you can see as to how new combinations of traits are formed in F 2  offspring when factors controlling for seed shape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form F 2  offspring. Thus the tall/short trait and the round seed/wrinkled seed trair are independently inherited."

Women have a perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called x. But men have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized x, while the other is a short one called y. So women are xx, while men are xy. As fig. shows half the children will be boys and half will be girls.

            "answer": "Classification shows how clearly organisms are closely related with respect do evolution. As we know that each organism has descended from its ancestral type with some modification. Classification involves grouping of organism based on similarities in internal and external structure or evolutionary history. Two species are more closely related, if they have more characteristics in common. Different organisms would have common features if they are inherited from a common ancestor. And, if two species are more closely related, then it means they have a more recent ancestor. With subsequent generations, the variations make organisms more different than their ancestors. This discussion clearly proves that we classify organisms according to their resemblance which is similar to creating an evolutionary tree."

Haldane, a British scientist (who became a citizen of India later), suggested in 1929 that life must have developed from the simple in organic molecules which were present on earth soon after it was formed. How did these organic molecules arise? An answer was suggested by the experiment conducted by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C Urey in 1953. They assembled an atmosphere similar to that thought to exist on early earth (this had molecules like ammonia, methane) and Hydrogen sulphide, but no oxygen) over water. This was maintained at a temperature just below 100° c and sparks were passed through the mixture of gases to stimulate lighting. At the end of a week, 15% of the carbon (from methane) had been converted to simple compounds of carbon including amino acids which make up protein molecules. This is the evidence we have for the life from inanimate matter."

            "question": "Explain how sexual reproduction gives rise to more viable variations than asexusal reproduction. How does this affect the evolution of those organisms that reproduce sexually?",
            "answer": "Sexual reproduction causes more viable variations due to the following reasons: Two different types of gametes meet to form new individuals which have better possibilities of combinations of traits. Due to the presence of multiple traits, error in copying of DNA are highly significant. At the time of gamete formation, random aggregation of paternal and maternal chromosome occurs. Exchange of genetic material may occur between , homologous chromosomes during formation of gametes. Due to sexual reproduction over generation after generation and selection by nature created wide diversity. In case of asexual reproduction, only the very small changes due to inaccuracies in DNA copying pass on the progeny. Thus, offsprings of asexual reproduction are more or less genetically similar to their parents. So, it can be concluded that evolution in sexually reproducing organisms proceeds at a faster pace than in asexually reproducing organisms."

            "answer": "Each cell will have two copies of each chromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ cell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either maternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring the stability of the DNA of the species. Hence there is equal genetic contribution of male and female parents ensured in the progeny."

            "answer": "Yes, we agree with the statement that only variations that confer an advantage to an individual organism will survive in a population. Genetic variations are part of natural selection. Genetic variations are one form of variation. Selection is done with respect to the environment. Every variation do not have a survival in the environment in which they exist. The chances of surviving depend upon adaptation by surrounding and the nature of variations. Selection of variants by environmental factors forms the basis for revolutionary process."

If we dig into the earth and start finding fossils, it is reasonable to suppose that the fossils we find closer to the surface are more recent than the fossils we find in deeper layers. The second way of dating fossils is by detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material. It would be interesting to find out exactly how this method works!"

            "question": "Why do stars twinkle?",
            "answer": "The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. This apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly, as the physical conditions of the earths atmosphere are not stationary since the stars are very distant, they approximate point – sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the’ apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount. Of starlight entering the eye flickers some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect."

If we consider a plant as a collection of a large number of point sized sources of light, the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect."

            "question": "Why does the Sun appear reddish early in the morning?",
            "answer": "Light from the Sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air and larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes. However, light from the Sun overhead would travel relatively shorter distance. At noon, the Sun appears white as only a little of the blue and violet colours are scattered. Near the horizon, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelengths. This gives rise to the reddish appearance of the Sun."

        {
            "question": "Why does the sky appear dark instead of blue to an astronaut?",
            "answer": "When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelength more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to astronaut flying at very high attitude, as scattering is not prominent at such heights."

Because of this tungsten is used almost exclusively for filament of electric lamps. (b) Why are the conductors of electric heating devices, such as bread- toasters and electric irons, made of an alloy rather than a pure metal? Answer: The resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily at high temperatures. Because of this reason the conductors of electric heating devices, such as bread-toasters and electric irons made of an alloy rather than a pure metal. (c) Why is the series arrangement not used-for domestic circuits? Answer: In case of series connection, when one component fails, the circuit it broken and none of the components work. But in case of parallel connection, circuit divides the current throughout the electrical gadgets. Because of this reason series arrangement is not used for domestic purposes. (d) How does the resistance of a wire vary with its area of cross-section? Answer: Resistance is inversely proportional to its cross section. As area is increasing resistance is less. Thus resistance of wire is changing with area of cross section. (e) Why are copper and aluminium wires usually employed for electricity transmission?

            "answer": "Principle: An electric motor is a rotating device that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy working. Working: Current in the coil ABCD enters from the source battery through conducting brush X and flow back to the battery through brush Y. Notice that the current in the Arm AB of the coil flows from A to B. In arm CD it flows from C to D that is opposite to the direction of current through arm AB on applying Fleming’s left hand rule for the direction of force on a current¬carrying conductor in a magnetic field. We find that the force acting on arm AB pushes it downwards while the force acting on arm CD pushes it upwards. Thus the coil and the Axle O, mounted free to turn about an axis, rotate anti-clockwise at half rotation. Q makes contact with the brush X and P with brush Y. Therefore the current in the coil gets reversed and flows along the path DCBA. The reversal of current also reverses the direction of force acting on the two arms AB and CD. Thus the arm AB of the coil that was earlier pushed down, is now pushed up and the arm CD previously pushed up is pushed down. There is a continuous rotation of the coil and to the axle. Split rings in electric motors acts as a commutator."

            "question": "Explain the underlying principle and working of an electric generator by drawing a labelled diagram. What is the function of the brushes?",
            "answer": "Principle: In an electric generator, mechanical energy is used to rotate a conductor in a magnetic field to produce electricity. It is working on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Working: When the Axle attached to the two rings is rotated such that the arm AB moves up (and the arm CD moves down) in the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnet. Let us say the coil ABCD is rotated clockwise in the arrangement. By applying Fleming’s right-hand rule, the induced currents are set up in these arms along with the directions AB and CD. Thus an induced current flows in the direction ABCD. If there are a larger number of turns in the coil, the current generated in each turn adds up to give a large current through the coil. This means that the current in the external circuit flows from B 2  and B 1 . After half a rotation, arm CD starts moving up and AB moving down. As a result, the directions of the induced currents in both the arms change, giving rise to the net induced current in the direction DCBA. The current in the external circuit now flows from B 1  to B 2 . Thus after every half rotation the polarity of the current in the respective arms changes. There are two brushes and in the electric generator, one brush is at all times in contact with the arm moving up in the field, while the other is in contact with the arm moving down. Because of these Brushes unidirectional current is produced."

For example in a water lifting pump, the rotatory motion of windmill is utilized to lift water from a well. Today wind energy is also used to generate electricity. A windmill essentially consists of a structure similar to a large electric fan that is erected at some height on a rigid support. A number of windmills are erected over a large area, which is known as wind energy farm. The energy output of each windmill in a farm is coupled together to get electricity on a commercial scale wind energy farms can be established only at those places where wind blows for the greater part of a year. The wind speed should also be higher than 15 km/h to maintain the required speed of the turbine, since, the tower and blades are exposed to the vagaries of nature like rain, sun, storm and cyclone, they need a high level of maintenance.   (2) Water energy: In order to produce hydel electricity, high rise dams are constructed on the river to obstruct the flow of water and thereby collect water in larger reservoirs. The water level rises and in this process the kinetic energy of flowing water gets transformed into potential energy. The water from the high level in the dam is carried through pipes, to the turbine, at the bottom of the dam. Sine the water in the reservoir would be refilled each time. It rains (hydropower is a renewable source of energy) we would not have to worry about hydro electricity sources getting used up the way fossil fuels would get finished one day."

Another advantage is that they can-be set up in remote and in accessible hamlets or very sparsely inhabited areas in which laying of a power transmission line may be expensive and not commercially viable. ii) Wind energy: Unequal heating of the landmass and water bodies by solar radiation generates air movement and causes winds to blow. This kinetic energy of the wind can be used to work. Wind energy is an environment-friendly and efficient source of renewable energy. It requires no recurring expenses for the production of electricity."

            "question": "Compare and contrast bio-mass and hydro electricity as sources of energy.",
            "answer": "Bio-mass: Cow-dung, various plant materials like the residue after . harvesting the crops, vegetable waste and sewage are decomposed in the absence of oxygen to give biogas. Since the starting material is mainly cow-dung, it is popularly known as ‘gober gas’. Biogas is produced in biogas plant. Bio gas is an excellent fuel as it contains up to 75% Methane. It burns without smoke, leaves no residue like ash in wood, charcoal and coal burning. The slurry left behind is removed periodically and used as excellent manure. This is one of the renewable source of energy. Hydro Electricity: In order to produce hydel electricity, high rise dams are constructed on the river to obstruct the flow of water and thereby collect water level rises and in this process the kinetic energy of flowing water, gets transformed into potential energy. The water from the high level in the dam is carried through pipes to the turbine, at the bottom of the dam. Since the water in the reservoir would be refilled each time it rains. We would not have to worry about hydro electricity sources getting used up the way fossil fuels would get finished one day."
